# welcome!
Hey there! I'm a third year **computer engineering** student at [UC San
Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). My interests are in computer graphics, computer
vision, and a lot more. At the moment, I'm working on helping solve *inverse
rendering* problems by building a pipeline to reconstruct the unknown geometry,
camera positions, materials, etc. of an input scene -- advised by Professors 
[Ravi Ramamoorthi](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/) and 
[Tzu-Mao Li](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/).
