# Kevin Kang
Hey there, I'm Kevin! I'm a third year **computer engineering** student at 
[UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). My interests are in computer graphics,
computer vision, and a lot more. At the moment, I'm working under the
supervision of Professors 
[Ravi Ramamoorthi](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/) and 
[Tzu-mao Li](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/) on helping solve *inverse
rendering* problems by building a pipeline to reconstruct the unknown geometry,
camera positions, materials, etc. of an input scene.
