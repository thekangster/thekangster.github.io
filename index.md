# <a id="top"></a> welcome! 
I'm a third-year **computer engineering** student at [UC San
Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). My interests are in computer vision, graphics, and a
lot more. Currently, I'm working on helping solve *inverse rendering* problems
through building a pipeline to reconstruct unknown object geometry and
appearance from 2D images -- advised by Professors 
[Ravi Ramamoorthi](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/) and 
[Tzu-Mao Li](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/).
